This will help a practical app in reference category stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store.

    "We see how Microsoft Word, All-In-One Toolbox: Cleaner, Booster, App Manager, AVG Cleaner – Speed, Battery & Memory Booster and so on have a large number of installs. But these apps are about data, resources, battery management. If we look at our particular interesting category we can see: `Wunderlist: To-Do List & Tasks:10,000,000+, Todoist: To-do lists for task management & errands:10,000,000+, 'Any.do: To-do list, Calendar, Reminders & Planner:10,000,000+`. They are serious competitors, but some of them have an only free trial version or dividing by free and pro version. Anyway, we can create an app with some tips, resources, lists for tasks, etc. for fitness, workout, some sports. There is a lack of such specialized free apps and how we see the genre is fairly popular as well as on the Apple store (`Health & Fitness - 23298` average number of user ratings, `Productivity  - 21028`)."

Also, we can design some task management app and include special sections concretely for fitness needs. It could be a plan for exercises, time-tables, diet recommendations, daily to-do things to keep up with a shape. Also, as possible, we can create a game app with in-app adds, but both markets are really saturated with it. It will be hard to design something fresh, gripping and compete with huge corporations of video games."
